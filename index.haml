            Nashopoly is a game where Nashvillians or people who love Nashville can sit down and enjoy a game that involves, Nashopoly money, thinking strategies, and the enjoyment of people surrounding you. You can invest in rich properties that Nashville has to offer, along with collecting as much money as you can, but be careful. Make the wrong move and you could end up, broke, in jail, or out the game. Get ready, get set, and go get out the rat race.
