              FAQ
            </h2>
            1. Must I go around the board once before purchasing property?
            <br>
            No. You may begin purchasing property with the first available space you land on.
            <br>
            2. May I collect rent while in Jail?
            <br>
            Yes. You may collect rent and conduct business as usual while in Jail.
            <br>
            3. Do I get money for landing on Free Parking?
            <br>
            No. If you land on Free Parking, you receive no money, property or reward of any kind.
            <br>
            4. If I own all the properties of one color group, may I put three houses on only one property?
            <br>
            No. Remember to build evenly at all times. You may not put more than one house on any
            <br>
            property of a color group until each property
            <br>
            of that group has at least one house on it.
            <br>
            5. Must I wait until my turn to buy houses and hotels?
            <br>
            No. You may transact business - such as buying and
            <br>
            selling houses - any time on your turn or between moves by other players.
            <br>
            6. May I mortgage a piece of property to buy other properties, houses or hotels?
            <br>
            Yes. You may mortgage property to buy houses, hotels or other properties of any color group.
